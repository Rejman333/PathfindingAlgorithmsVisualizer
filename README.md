# Pathfinding Algorithms Visualizer

This project is a Pathfinding Algorithms Visualizer built in Python,
using Pygame for graphics. It allows users to create custom labyrinths and visualize different pathfinding algorithms
traversing the maze. The tool is designed to help users better understand how pathfinding algorithms work in real-time
by providing interactive and visual feedback.

#### Why was it created?

The main motivation behind creating this project was the desire to have a hands-on tool for testing and experimenting
with various pathfinding algorithms found in books and online resources. I wanted a visual platform where I could
explore and understand how these algorithms work in practice, beyond just theoretical knowledge. This visualizer allows
me to implement and observe the behavior of different algorithms in a customizable environment, making it easier to
learn, and compare them.

## To-Do Checklist:

As this project is still under development, hereâ€™s a list of upcoming features and tasks. This list will be expanded as
the project evolves:

- [ ] Creating a basic UI capable of displaying a map.
- [ ] Creating an interface that allows you to edit the map by: adding/removing walls, changing the beginning and end of
  the maze.
- [ ] Creating an interface for selecting the active algorithm, and configuring it.
- [ ] Support for **DFS** (Depth First Search).
- [ ] Support for **BFS**  (Breadth First Search).
- [ ] Support for **Dijkstra**'s Algorithm.
- [ ] Support for __A*__ Algorithm.
- [ ] Create better tools for visualisation control.
- [ ] Save and load map function.

## Optional ideas:

- [ ] Supporting a greater number of algorithms.
- [ ] Optional graph-type view.
- [ ] Adding difficult terrain and roads, affecting the cost of moving.
- [ ] Random labyrinth generation
- [ ] Addition of icons for better visualization.
- [ ] ...
